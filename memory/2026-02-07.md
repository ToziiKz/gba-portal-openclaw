## Architecture Update: Autonomous Multi-Agent System
- **Setup**: Configured 4 autonomous sub-agents running via CRON every 30 mins:
    - `DESIGNER`: Visuals, UX, animations (Landing focus).
    - `BUILDER/PM`: SEO, Content, Features (No-DB).
    - `DASHBOARD`: Staff internal tools, mocks (No-DB).
    - `CLEANER`: Anti-clutter, simplification.
- **Workflow**: Sub-agents write proposals/patches to `gba-portal/.agent/proposals/*.md`. Main agent (Chef de projet) reviews and applies changes.
- **Status**: All CRONs disabled (paused) by user request at end of session.

## Project State Update (GBA Portal)

    - **Concept**: Pure showcase, NO tactics/planning mentions. Focus on Story, Values, Shop, Sponsors.

    - **Hero**: Removed "badges" list. Fixed button blur issues (removed filters).
- **Dashboard (Private)**:
    - Accessed via `/login`. Contains all staff tools (Staff directory, Stock, etc.).
    - Mock data & Permission placeholders implemented.
