## Session 12:30 UTC
- **Action:** User requested to launch the site `gba-portal`.
- **Status:** Started dev server (Next.js) on port 3000. Public URL: `http://76.13.33.246:3000`.
- **Context:** User wants to provide a reference codebase ("gba-platform") from a previous version of the project.
- **Transfer:** User is uploading `gba-platform.zip` (~200MB) via SFTP to `/root/.openclaw/workspace`.
- **Issue:** Attempted unzip too early (upload incomplete). Waiting for user confirmation of transfer completion.
- **Plan:** Once uploaded, extract `gba-platform.zip` to `reference_site/` and use it as a reference for `gba-portal` development.
