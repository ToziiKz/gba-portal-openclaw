# memory/2026-02-19.md - Self-Improvement Audit

## 🤖 Summary
- **Repo Cleanliness**: Moderate. Detected several uncommitted changes in `gba-portal` and untracked files (`DATABASE.md`).
- **Logs/Failures**: Checked logs. Found standard migration error handling in `qmd/migrate-schema.ts` but no active crashing.
- **Actions Taken**:
    - Created a root `.gitignore` to prevent tracking OpenClaw internal logs (`memory/*.log`) and build artifacts.
- **Small Improvement Applied**: Standardized workspace exclusion to keep `git status` clean and focused on code.

## 📈 Quality Metrics
- **Context Depth**: Good. `MEMORY.md` is current.
- **Process**: Cron job successfully audited and applied a low-risk optimization.

## 🛠 Proof
- `ls -a .gitignore`: Verified creation.
- `git status --short`: Now cleaner (ignoring logs).

## [14:04 UTC] Compaction Flush - Session Updates
- **GBA Portal UI**: Optimized Landing Page video overlay brightness (reduced black veil to 45%).
- **Dashboard Coach UX**: 
    - Full color identity shift: switched primary accent from emerald to blue.
    - Accessibility: Enforced high-contrast theme (dark text on light background) for field usability.
    - New "Health/Roster Status" Widget: Displays real-time eligibility (license/payment) and logistics (equipment sizes/pending packs).
- **Database Context**: Verified and mapped 'matches' and 'match_lineups' tables for tactical planning. Updated logic to use 'firstname/lastname' instead of 'first_name/last_name' per schema.
- **Environment**: Next.js dev server running on port 3001 (port 3000 occupied).

## [17:48 UTC] Memory Optimization Pass
- User requested stronger memory continuity across compactions and future sessions.
- Action: rewrote `MEMORY.md` into a compact long-term format (durable decisions + schema truths + pending checks).
- Added explicit protocol to separate stable memory (`MEMORY.md`) from volatile logs (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
- Added pre-coding post-compaction read order to reduce context drift.
- Result: faster recovery path after compaction, lower token overhead, better consistency.
