## 📥 Session Update (Afternoon) - 15:02 UTC
### 🎨 Web Design (Premium Overhaul)
- **Landing Page**: Smooth section transitions implemented using higher vertical gradients (h-24 -> h-32) for seamless blending.
- **News Page**: Fully redesigned as a high-end magazine layout with featured hero articles, glassmorphism badges, and cinematic typography (Teko 9xl).
- **Sponsors Page**: Rebuilt with a B2B premium focus. Included a "Wall of Fame" logo grid (grayscale to color on hover) and impact statistics.
- **Contact Page**: Modernized with a massive hero title ("Parlons Projet.") and thematic contact "tickets" (Partnerships, Staff, Registration).
- **Shop Page**: Implemented a "Luxe Technique" design. Added a technical grid pattern (Blueprint), ambient noise texture, and hover animations (Scanner shimmer effect, glowing prices, and rotating icons).
- **Color Palette**: Added subtle Amber/Gold accents to the shop to complement the existing Cyan/Blue theme.

### ⚽ Dashboard & Tactical Module
- **Tactical Board**: Integrated 3 substitute slots (R1, R2, R3). Implemented a "Pre-match" validation flow.
- **Database Schema**: Created `matches` and `match_lineups` tables in Supabase to store game data (date, opponent, formation, starters vs subs).
- **Planning Module**: Added a site switcher (Ittenheim / Achenheim) and improved the layout to support multiple sessions per week per team.

### 🛠 Technical Maintenance
- **Dependencies**: Updated `react`, `react-dom` (19.2.4) and `lucide-react` (0.475.0) using `--legacy-peer-deps` to resolve conflicts.
- **Server**: Performed several full builds and clean restarts to ensure production environment reflects visual/code changes.
